The Docker images that use `FROM: scratch` aren't really from scratch, they require a rootfs.tar.xz to get started. I was curious on how to build these so I created this script to build one in a docker image, but that requires an initial rootfs...

After the first rootfs is built, it will point to the rootfs it last built to build the next rootfs.
